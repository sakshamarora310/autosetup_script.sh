# autosetup_script.sh
I have developed a really simple script to setup your script.
I used to deploy a lot of machines and this scripts sets up pretty much everything I need.

This script performs the following things
1. Change the Hostname
2. Add a MOTD
3. Add a SSH Banner
4. Update the Machine

I am working on more scripts and features to automate majority things.

Stay Tuned for more scripts.

Thank you
